#### 🚀 Enhancements:
- Redesigned the dashboard with a queue table, right-side filters, and collapsible panels
- Moved workspace loading to cached metadata and delayed full analysis until requested
- Refreshed the login screen and added asset versioning for CSS and JS reloads
- Cached dashboard analyses to avoid reloading the dataset on repeated page refreshes
- Renamed the ingestion panels to `Data Ingestion` and `Data Processing Queue`
- Updated production Docker compose to pull published Docker Hub images
- Added login hero logo placement and refined login spacing
- Replaced the browser delete confirm with a styled confirmation modal
- Added multi-file upload with chunked file writes for large datasets
- Updated the queue to refresh progress live without page reloads
- Switched the upload file picker copy to English labels
- Added finer-grained dataset processing progress updates for large files
- Refined the workspace selector layout and queue action button styling
- Renamed the dataset summary panel to `Selected Dataset`
- Added multi-KPI dashboard rendering from the adaptive filters panel
- Moved workspace queries to materialized dataset tables in SQLite
- Added a workspace logs panel with `Info` and `Error` filtering
- Renamed `Data Processing Queue` to `Data Processing`
- Expanded the executive dashboard with global KPIs and per-metric KPI cards
- Added date-range filtering based on `Call Start Time`
- Added `City` filters and multi-select adaptive filters across the workspace
- Added per-chart aggregation overrides for individual comparison charts
- Persisted editable `Workspace` and `Admin` form state in browser storage
- Restored the last opened workspace dataset automatically on return
- Persisted collapse state for workspace and admin panels
- Replaced native multi-select boxes with dropdown multi-select controls and `Select All / None`
- Refined executive metric cards into visual subpanels grouped inside `Executive Dashboard`
- Improved dataset kind detection for `CDR-Speech` and `CDR-Data`
- Reduced PowerPoint export time by reusing cached export files and condensing metric output into fewer slides
- Added dataset size visibility in the `Data Processing` queue with MB labels
- Accelerated dashboard refreshes on large datasets by reducing analysis query columns and indexing materialized filter dimensions

#### 🐛 Bug fixes:
- Fixed default access visibility to reflect active users with default passwords only
- Prevented removing, deactivating, or demoting the last active admin user
- Fixed embedded document images to resolve project `static` asset paths
- Fixed empty-state body copy alignment in the workspace panels
- Fixed dataset selector filtering so all datasets show when no type filter is set
- Fixed the dataset picker to react immediately when `Input Type` changes
- Fixed the upload file input overlay so `Upload and process` submits directly
- Fixed failed processing caused by duplicate column names like `Campaign/campaign`
- Fixed dashboard fallback for legacy `ready` datasets without materialized tables
- Fixed workspace dataset selection to exclude non-ready datasets
- Fixed queue rows to show the dataset `last_error` directly in the workspace
- Fixed date filtering for datasets using spaced headers like `Call Start Time`
- Fixed the dashboard global aggregation selector to stay independent from per-chart overrides
- Fixed lowercase CSV dimensions like `operator` and `region` so chart aggregations work
- Fixed grouped percentiles to fall back gracefully when the chosen comparison has no usable grouped rows
- Fixed `Workspace -> Open` so the clicked dataset stays authoritative even when a stale `input_kind` is present
- Fixed global CDF comparison updates to apply on the first dashboard refresh
- Fixed `Global CDF Comparison` and `Global Aggregation` to persist their last selected values across dashboard returns
- Fixed dashboard relaunch and dataset reopen flows so persisted global CDF and aggregation selections are restored even when `/dashboard` loads with only `dataset_id`
- Fixed legacy materialized dashboard tables to stop rebuilding on every refresh when structural columns only differ by case
- Refined normalized `Technology Primary` for data datasets to prioritize `RAT` and stop deriving it from `PCell_RAT_Timeline`
- Renamed the dashboard-facing `Technology Primary` label to `Technology` while keeping the normalized field key stable
- Added automatic stale-dataset normalization refresh on dashboard open so cached filter options and materialized rows pick up normalization rule changes
- Reworked stale-dataset normalization refresh to migrate cached technology values from the materialized table instead of rebuilding giant datasets during dashboard open
- Optimized large-dashboard CDF rendering by increasing chart sample density and rebuilding grouped comparisons from the actual filtered series so multi-operator CDF views keep all visible curves
- Rebalanced CDF payload size with an adaptive per-chart point budget so giant dashboards open quickly again even when several metrics and comparison curves are rendered together
- Fixed dashboard state persistence from being overwritten by bare `dataset_id + load=1` opens, restoring reliable persistence for `Global CDF Comparison` and `Global Aggregation`
- Fixed app relaunch persistence for `Global CDF Comparison` and `Global Aggregation` when dashboard bootstrap URLs explicitly carried the default `all` values
- Fixed persisted global dashboard selectors to restore correctly even when the incoming dashboard URL already contains `aggregation=all` or `cdf_grouping=all`
- Fixed restored global dashboard selectors to push their persisted values back into the dashboard URL so child CDF and bar charts render with the same global settings after app relaunch
- Changed `Adaptive Filters` persistence to be dataset-specific so metrics, dates and dimension filters restore independently for each dataset when switching back and forth
- Fixed dashboard dataset switching to load the target dataset with its persisted filters before the first render, preventing default filters from flashing and being resubmitted accidentally
- Fixed `Workspace -> Open` and live queue `Open` actions to enter `/dashboard` through the dataset-specific persisted query, so restored filters are visible from the first dashboard paint
- Added per-chart horizontal CDF range sliders with an automatic multi-series default cutoff based on the highest X value shared by at least two curves
- Simplified the default CDF slider cutoff back to the last X value still shared by at least two curves; `Single CDF` keeps the full range by default
- Refined the default CDF slider cutoff to use the lower of the shared multi-curve X limit and the point where all visible curves have already reached 0.95 on the Y axis
- Fixed bar-chart normalization so the highest bar always reaches the top of the Y axis even when every value is below `1`
- Added CDF axis labels and metric units in dashboard and export charts so the plotted values are identifiable at a glance
- Updated PowerPoint chart exports to honor each CDF chart's default horizontal X range and to render vertical Y-axis labels for both CDF and bar charts
- Fixed PowerPoint metric KPI strips so all six KPI cards render instead of only `Max`
- Fixed data filter ordering so `Test Name` appears between `Vendor` and `Region`

#### 📚 Documentation:
- Added `Readme` and `Changelog` navigation with Markdown document viewer
- Added the app logo at the top of the `README`
- Fixed document links to open `Readme` and `Changelog` in a new tab
